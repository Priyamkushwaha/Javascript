// let keyword
// declare variable with let keyword

let firstName = "Priyam";
console.log(firstName);

//difference between var and let
// var yourName = "Priyam";
// var yourName = "Raghav";
// console.log(yourName);
// let yourName = "Priyam";
// let yourName = "Raghav";// it will give error that this variable is already defined
// console.log(yourName);

// why we need to use let over var
// block scope vs function scope 

//in for loop the var variable can be accessed outside the loop and but let variable can not be accessed outside the loop
